# playtesthub — Full Version History

## v2.1 — 2026-05-08

**Admin RBAC reframed: APPUI is the design choice, not a workaround**:
- §6 AuthZ rewritten to document the *existing* per-RPC `(resource, action)` permission gate that has shipped since M1 phase 8 (declared via proto options, enforced by the `accelbyte-go-sdk` permission validator). Resource locked in as **`ADMIN:NAMESPACE:{namespace}:EXTEND:APPUI`** — the AppUI-admin perm held by every namespace-admin role studios already assign (Game Admin / Studio Admin / equivalent). Per-RPC action bits made explicit: CREATE for create/upload/top-up, READ for list/get, UPDATE for edit/approve/reject/retry/transition/sync, DELETE for soft-delete. The PRD now explains *why APPUI* (entry surface match + zero AGS-side role setup) and *why not `CUSTOM:ADMIN:NAMESPACE:{namespace}:PLAYTEST`* (Shared Cloud blocks game admins from assigning `CUSTOM:*` perms — AccelByte-only, on the AGS roadmap).
- §9 R8 reframed — risk downgraded from "ships without RBAC, UNSAFE FOR PRODUCTION" to "RBAC is a coarse single namespace-admin permission bit; everyone with namespace-admin tier becomes a playtest admin; the `AuditLog` is the per-actor accountability layer". A dedicated finer-grained role remains post-MVP and is gated on AGS allowing `CUSTOM:*` assignment in Shared Cloud.
- §2 non-goals, §3 studio admin, §5 accountability note, §8 key assumptions, §10 M3 README walkthrough cross-references updated to point at the documented permission gate (no behavior change vs. v2.0; this is documentation honesty, not a code change).
- README header swapped from the old "not production safe — no admin RBAC" warning to an "admin authorization" note describing the gate and which roles satisfy it.
- `errors.md` adds a `PermissionDenied` row (any admin RPC, missing `EXTEND:APPUI` at required action) and an `Unauthenticated` row (any RPC, missing/invalid Bearer token).
- `engineering.md` rewrite (drop the "AppUI-admin workaround pending CUSTOM:* assignment" framing → document APPUI as the permanent design choice) tracked as M3 phase 18; no proto / generated-stub / interceptor change needed.

## v2.0 — 2026-04-17

**Admin UI delivery migrated to Extend App UI**:
- §5.7 — admin pages now delivered via AGS **Extend App UI** (experimental). React 19 + Vite + Module Federation remote, hosted by AccelByte under **Extend → My Extend Apps → App UI**. Ant Design v6 + Tailwind v4. Typed clients + react-query hooks generated from grpc-gateway OpenAPI (`apidocs/api.json`) via `@accelbyte/codegen`. Auth inherited from Admin Portal `HostContext`; `@accelbyte/sdk-iam` owns token lifecycle. Legacy `justice-adminportal-extension-website` + `justice-ui-library` path is **no longer used**.
- §4.2 — dev onboarding step 5 updated: `extend-helper-cli appui create` + `appui upload` replaces the extension-site registration.
- §8 Extend features — Extend App UI added as required; legacy extension-site path moved to "not used in MVP".
- §9 — new **R11**: Extend App UI availability constrained to **Internal Shared Cloud only** at MVP time; Private Cloud adopters deferred until GA.
- Corresponding updates in `architecture.md` (admin frontend section rewritten) and `engineering.md` (new base-template section, repo layout, test/CI/local-dev guidance for the admin app).

## v1.9 — 2026-04-17

**User decisions**:
- **AGS 429 → fail-fast**: §4.6 retry policy clarified — HTTP 5xx and timeouts retry up to 3× with exponential backoff; 4xx including 429 fail immediately and surface as gRPC `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.
- **DM resilience**: §5.4 adds circuit breaker (50 consecutive failures within 60s → pause queue 5 min, auto-resume; new approves still enqueue while tripped; tripped DMs surface `lastDmError='dm_circuit_open'`). New `RetryFailedDms(playtestId)` bulk RPC and admin "Retry all failed DMs" button. New `dm.circuit_opened` / `dm.circuit_closed` audit actions (system-attributed).
- **Code-pool low-water at ≤10% remaining**: banner on Key Pool page and Applicants page (point-of-use). No audit, no DM, no email. R3 in §9 updated.
- **Strict linear status transitions**: `DRAFT → OPEN → CLOSED` only; `DRAFT → CLOSED` rejected with `FailedPrecondition`. `EditPlaytest` whitelist defined explicitly: editable — `title`, `description`, `bannerImageUrl`, `platforms`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `ndaRequired`, `ndaText`. Immutable — `slug`, `namespace`, `status`, `distributionModel`, `initialCodeQuantity`, all `ags*` IDs, all timestamps. Editing an immutable field returns `InvalidArgument` with the offending field name.

**Mechanical fixes**:
- §5.7 audit-log viewer flagged as M3 cut-if-behind candidate (writes in M2 remain mandatory).
- `ListAuditLog`: `actorFilter='system'` defined to map to `actorUserId IS NULL`.
- §5.4 DM restart sweep: idempotency guard added — sweep only re-marks `lastDmStatus IS NULL` or `'pending'`, preserves prior `'failed'` reason.
- §4.6 / M2: AGS sub-cap 4 (code fetch) failure treated same as 1–3 (defer AGS_CAMPAIGN entirely); sub-cap 5 (delete cleanup) failure ships initial-generate-only path with WARN log.
- `CreatePlaytest` request docs read "Playtest fields *except `status`*" (DRAFT default server-side).
- `AuditLog.action` enum source of truth is `schema.md`; PRD references it.
- `CreatePlaytest` slug collision: `AlreadyExists` (gRPC error-code reference table updated).
- Status transitions: explicit "DRAFT → CLOSED is invalid; admins must transition through OPEN."
- §5.1: `Playtest.namespace` populated from `AGS_NAMESPACE` env var at insert time; no per-request override.
- §7 / §8: demo perf measurement via `/scripts/loadtest/` (referenced not implemented), reported in CHANGELOG, not a CI gate for MVP.
- §6 NFR: clock skew assumption (server clock drift < `reservationTtl/2`; NTP sync required).
- §5.2 / §5.4 / `dm-queue.md`: `lastDmError` byte-truncation specified to preserve valid UTF-8 codepoint boundaries.

**Aggressive trim / extractions**:
- New file `docs/ags-failure-modes.md` extracted from §4.6 (retry policy, partial-failure cleanup, code-generation pagination, sub-cap failure matrix). §4.6 reduced to summary + link.
- New file `docs/dm-queue.md` extracted from §5.4 (FIFO mechanics, overflow, restart sweep, circuit breaker, bulk retry, truncation). §5.4 reduced to summary + link.
- §9 R1–R10 risks compressed to one-line entries with cross-references.
- §5.7 admin pages compressed to one-liners per page with cross-references.
- v1.7 / v1.8 inline rationale comments removed from PRD; rationale lives in this CHANGELOG entry and v1.8 entry below.
- PRD preamble (lines 7–11 of v1.8) removed — version history now lives entirely in CHANGELOG.
- §2 non-goals compressed to flat bulleted list (no rationale paragraphs).
- §5.1 mutation matrix and admin-RPC matrix merged into single canonical Table A; redundant prose removed.
- §6 Time zones reduced from 6 bullets to 2.
- §1, §3, §4.2, §4.4, §4.5, §5.2, §5.3, §5.5, §5.6, §5.8, §6 Security/Idempotency/Pagination/Versioning/Observability, §7, §8, §10 trimmed of redundant prose throughout.

**v1.8 rationale (extracted from PRD preamble)**:
- `dmTemplate` override made contributor-optional (open source).
- Soft-delete restore formally non-goal.
- Custom-domain feature dropped (Extend-hostname only).

**v1.7 rationale (extracted from PRD preamble)**:
- `survey.create` admin attribution.
- DM-queue restart sweep.
- M2 sub-caps 6/7 (TopUpCodes, SyncFromAGS).
- M2 audit `applicant.approve` / `applicant.reject`.

<summary>v1.5 changelog (from v1.4)</summary>

**Inconsistencies fixed**:
- §5.1 — Soft-delete absoluteness: a CLOSED-then-soft-deleted playtest revokes direct-link access for previously-approved players. `GetGrantedCode` returns 404 for any soft-deleted playtest regardless of applicant state.
- §5.1 AuditLog comment — clarified `applicant.dm_sent` is admin-attributed (actorUserId = Retry DM clicker); no longer ambiguous with system-emitted list.
- §4.6 step 1 — `CreatePlaytest` ALWAYS returns `status = DRAFT`; no `status` field accepted in create request. Only `TransitionPlaytestStatus` leaves DRAFT.
- §4.6 — Partial-fulfillment detection: rollback trigger is HTTP non-2xx OR AGS error field set. HTTP 2xx with codes commits; `count < requested` emits warning.
- §5.1 — Permission matrix split into **Table A (admin actions by status)** and **Table B (audit events + attribution)**. Audit events fire whenever their trigger fires; status gating is expressed in Table A only.
- §5.4/§5.5/§8/§10 — "Pool-only grant" defined once in §4.1 step 6; other occurrences now cross-reference without restating.

**Content moved to `schema.md`** (new file):
- §5.1 AuditLog `action` enum + JSONB payload shapes for each action.
- §5.5 `Code` table schema + `leader_lease` table schema.
- §5.6 `Survey` + `SurveyResponse` entity specs (column types, question shape, multi-choice option bounds).

**Content deleted from PRD**:
- Appendix B (Resolved questions Q1–Q40).
- Top-of-PRD changelog summary block (mirrored CHANGELOG.md).
- §6 axe-core `^4.10.0` version pin — replaced with "pinned in CI; see CI config".

**Minor gaps closed**:
- §4.6 — AGS_CAMPAIGN top-up concurrency: `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(playtestId))`, same discipline as CSV upload.
- §5.4 — Discord DM internal throttle: DMs queued post-approval, worker emits at configurable safe rate (≈5/s default); approval RPC returns immediately.
- §8 — Bounds rationale: `initialCodeQuantity 1–50,000`, 100 playtests/namespace, 10 MB / 50k-line CSV are MVP safety limits, not AGS-imposed.
- §6 Performance — Perf target raised to **p95 < 3s end-to-end (user-perceived)**, inclusive of AGS IAM + Discord OAuth redirect time. §7 and §10 proof points updated.
- §6 Time zones — Admin input in admin browser TZ; server stores UTC; `endsAt is past` evaluated against server UTC clock; players see UTC-derived state.
- §5.3 — NDA hash: normalize before sha256 (trim trailing whitespace per line, CRLF→LF, collapse trailing newlines to a single terminal LF).
- §6 Accessibility — Admin UI fully excluded from automated a11y CI (audit log viewer, survey builder, etc.); no manual a11y smoke-test required.
- §5.2 — `discordHandle` storage: raw UTF-8 from Discord API, no sanitization; column is Postgres `TEXT`. Deleted Discord accounts: no reconciliation — archival text.
- §6 Versioning & compatibility — gRPC versioned in proto package (`v1`, `v2`); breaking changes = new package; no formal compat SLA; single deployment owns backend + player app.
- §4.6 — AGS API retry policy: 30s timeout, up to 3 retries with exponential backoff on 5xx/timeout; 4xx no retry. Initial-create sequence keeps its own 300s-no-retry policy.

**New files**:
- `docs/schema.md` — full schema definitions (AuditLog action enum + payload shapes, Code/leader_lease, Survey entity).
- `docs/STATUS.md` — build/implementation status tracker (milestones M0–M4 from §10, all `not started` on v1.5 cut).

**PRD meta**:
- Top-of-PRD now points at `CHANGELOG.md`, `schema.md`, and `STATUS.md` from a single line under the version header.

- §5.1 — Permission matrix: `campaign.create` and `campaign.create_failed` OPEN → **no** (fires only during CreatePlaytest in DRAFT).
- §5.2/§5.3 — NDA re-accept logic deduplicated; §5.3 is canonical, §4.1 and §5.2 cross-reference.
- §5.5 — Code state machine prose trimmed; cross-references §4.1 step 6.
- §5.6 — Multi-choice option bounds: 2–20 entries, server-enforced.

- §8 — Extend SDK handles AGS token refresh automatically (assumption).
- §8 — AGS Platform Campaign API deduplicated (removed from External dependencies, cross-references AGS services).
- §9 — R11: namespace decommission means data loss; self-host operators responsible for backups.
- §10 M1 — Discord handle fetched once at signup, never refreshed.
- Appendix A — Full changelogs moved to `CHANGELOG.md`.
